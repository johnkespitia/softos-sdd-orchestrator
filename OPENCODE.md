# SoftOS OpenCode Context

Use this file as the root operational contract when the assistant does not load `.agents/skills/**` directly.

## Core rules

- Root `specs/**` is the source of truth.
- `.flow/**` is operational state only.
- Read the target spec and `workspace.config.json` before non-trivial edits.
- Run workspace-managed commands from the devcontainer by default with `python3 ./flow workspace exec -- <cmd>` or `scripts/workspace_exec.sh <cmd>`.
- `flow` invoked from host is blocked by default (`FLOW_FORCE_WORKSPACE_EXEC=1`) unless it is `flow stack ...` or explicit `flow workspace exec -- ...`.
- Run repo runtime commands in the repo service with `python3 ./flow repo exec <repo> -- <cmd>`. Reserve `workspace exec` for workspace-managed tooling.
- If the command must validate a materialized slice, prefer `python3 ./flow repo exec <repo> --workdir <worktree> -- <cmd>` so runtime resolution happens against that worktree.
- For governance/enforcement/minimal-change/verification-only slices, use the spec closeout contract instead of guessing whether more surface work is needed.
- If the spec permits preservation-only closure, prefer the minimum valid diff plus evidence over continued analysis.
- Do not edit files outside the active spec `targets` unless the spec changes first.
- Treat `status: released` as terminal:
  - valid for CI and traceability
  - not valid for re-planning or re-execution
- Prefer `flow` commands for lifecycle actions:
  - `flow spec review|approve`
  - `flow plan`
  - `flow workflow next-step|execute-feature|run`
  - `flow ci spec|repo|integration`
  - `flow release cut|promote|verify|publish`
  - `flow stack plan|apply`

## CI delegation

- If a repo declares project-owned CI in `workspace.config.json`, SoftOS root CI dispatches it.
- Delegated child workflows must use `workflow_dispatch` only.
- Do not configure delegated child workflows with `push` or `pull_request`.

## Compose federation

- If a repo already has its own compose file, include it in the workspace stack.
- Do not duplicate that service in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`.

## Release model

- Operational feature releases use `flow release cut|promote|verify`.
- OSS repo releases use `flow release publish`.
- Use `flow release publish --dry-run --skip-github --json` before publishing.
