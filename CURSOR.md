# SoftOS Cursor CLI Context

Use this file when Cursor CLI does not load `.cursor/rules/**` automatically.

## Mandatory SoftOS guardrails

- Root `specs/**` is the source of truth.
- `.flow/**` is operational state only; never treat it as canonical intent.
- Read the active spec and `workspace.config.json` before non-trivial edits.
- Resolve repo/runtime from spec `targets` and workspace routing.
- Run workspace-managed commands from the devcontainer by default with `python3 ./flow workspace exec -- <cmd>` or `scripts/workspace_exec.sh <cmd>`.
- `flow` en host está en modo estricto por defecto (`FLOW_FORCE_WORKSPACE_EXEC=1`): bloquea comandos no-`stack` fuera de `workspace` y exige `flow workspace exec -- ...`.
- Run repo runtime commands in the repo service with `python3 ./flow repo exec <repo> -- <cmd>`. Do not run PHPUnit, Composer, pnpm, pytest or Go test in `workspace` when the repo has its own service.
- When validating a slice worktree, use `python3 ./flow repo exec <repo> --workdir <worktree> -- <cmd>` so the runner resolves files from the slice under test, not from the base checkout.
- For governance/enforcement/minimal-change/verification-only slices, honor the spec closeout contract: `surface_policy`, `minimum_valid_completion`, `validated_noop_allowed`, and `acceptable_evidence`.
- If no mandatory expansion appears after a short review, close with enforcement/tests/verification evidence instead of reopening scope.
- Do not edit files outside the active spec `targets` unless the spec changes first.
- Prefer `python3 ./flow ...` commands for lifecycle actions over ad hoc shell flows.
- Treat `status: released` as terminal: valid for CI/traceability, not valid for re-planning or re-execution.
- If a spec is already approved or implementation-ready but still leaves major execution choices open, run the reference-grade hardening pass with `.agents/skills/softos-reference-spec-hardening/SKILL.md` before treating it as a stable execution reference.
- If a staging promotion depends on GitHub dispatch or rollout-sensitive migrations, validate the preflight from the `workspace` devcontainer and treat the outcome as binary: dispatchable or blocked.

## Required lifecycle behavior

Before claiming completion, run the relevant gates:

- `python3 ./flow ci spec --all --json` or the relevant `flow ci spec <spec>`
- `python3 ./flow ci repo --all --json` when implementation behavior changed
- `python3 ./flow ci integration --profile smoke:ci-clean --auto-up --json` when stack or cross-repo behavior changed

## Explicit prohibitions

- Do not implement first and repair specs later.
- Do not duplicate CI logic when `root-ci.yml` already dispatches project CI.
- Do not duplicate compose services when the repo already owns a compose file.
- Do not use `.flow/state` or `.flow/reports` to justify product behavior over specs.
- Do not close work without spec/governance alignment.
